"""voice-guard: your voice pass, run before every post.

The check is not new. Since unit 2, repro-check's live mode has read
voice-guide.md and held every outgoing draft against the author's own
rules, quoting the rule a draft breaks. This checker runs the SAME
pass (one canonical guide, one contract, the same quoted-rule output)
as a Claude Code PreToolUse hook, so it fires on every outgoing
`gh issue comment` / `gh pr comment` / `gh issue create` /
`gh pr create` body by construction, instead of when someone
remembers to invoke a skill.

Two modes, one contract:

  hook mode (no arguments): invoked by Claude Code with the tool-call
    JSON on stdin (see hooks-settings.json). Commands that carry no
    outgoing body pass through untouched and cost nothing. An
    outgoing command has its body checked against voice-guide.md in
    this directory: a clean draft posts; a draft that breaks a rule
    is stopped with the exact rule quoted (exit 2).

  manual mode (--draft FILE): the same check on a draft file, for
    comments you will post from the browser. Prints the verdict.
    Exit 0 on pass, 2 on stop.

Every check appends one dated line to guard-log.md next to this
file. That log is your guard transcript.

The guard is a live-mode-only seam: nothing invokes it in eval mode,
and it never reads or changes the scout, your rubric, or the unit-1
harness interface. It checks voice rules only; it never judges the
technical content of what you post.

Honesty note: the guard checks commands it can read. Posting from a
bare terminal, or through a command form it does not parse (a raw
`gh api` POST), walks around it, exactly like not running a skill. It
is a check on your own words, not a security system; what it adds
is that inside Claude Code, where you work, the check always runs.
